As a FIRST Robotics Competition team who is dedicated to providing a rich learning enviornment for its members and always seeks to extend our positive influence in the community, we are always in need of resources and help from those who have a passion in STEM. We would love if you could support our students in their quest to achieve their goals and learn valuable skills in any of the ways below!

## Become a Mentor
We are always looking for expertise in programming, electronics, engineering, mechanics, design, marketing, finances, and business who can share their knowledge with our members. If you are interested in helping out high school students and would like to volunteer in any capacity as a mentor for Team 3128 or have any questions, please let us know!

## Donate
If you are a parent or family member of a narwhal, please help us out by donating! Our team needs many resources - electronics, lumber, gearboxes, aluminum, polycarbonate, coaching, travel, to name a few - that we can't get without your support. We request donations from every family in order to continue our mission to create a unique learning environment for our members.
