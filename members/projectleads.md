For the 2020-2021 season, our team will have Project Leader positions in addition to the Division Coordinators. Any Division Coordinator may seek self-nominations for a specific Project Lead position within their Division.

The project leaders will work closely with their corresponding division coordinator in managing the progress of the certain project he or she is in charge of. Some responsibilies of a project leader may include planning, attending and/or documenting project meetings. In the case that the division coordinator is unable to attend a meeting, project leads may also be able to serve as a proxy. 

If members have any projects they are interested in leading, they should reach out to the leadership team and their respective department coordinator!
